=====================================================*/

【Quick Start】

If you can accept the default text, you can set up quickly.

(1) At "Settings" > "Contact Form" on your WordPress Admin Panel, on the green area, set empty without "E-mail Address to receive E-mails via this plugin ( If empty, this plugin will use your Admin E-mail Address )".

(2) Open allpost-contactform.js, and add a new function for Japanese language to it. If you use the default function, "checkForm", for English language, the new function for Japanese language has to have a new name like this: "checkFormJa".

(3) Set the function for your html form page written in Japanese language.　Change the default function, "checkForm", to the new function, "checkFormJa".

(4) Upload the files to allpost-contactform directory of your server.

Use allpost-contactform.js packed together with this file. It's the same file of our official DEMO. You can　confirm the functions on our official DEMO.
